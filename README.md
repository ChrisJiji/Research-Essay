# Unveiling pitfalls and exploring alternatives in the use of pilot studies for sample size estimation

Paper and code for my master's research paper for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Mathematics in Statistics at the University of Waterloo. [code.Rmd](code.Rmd) contains all of the code to generate the data and plots in the paper, in the order that they are presented. Each code block in the .Rmd section corresponds to a different subsection, and is completely self-contained.
